# Take-Quiz
A Sample Quiz page.
The provided files contains the html structure, css styling and javascript of the quiz page.
Note: Download the files, Create a folder named as "js" and keep only " questions.js" and "script.js" files in it.
Open html file then click on "start quiz" button, you will find some instructions about answering the questions and scores.
Read them and click "Next" to take the quiz.
Once you start, 15 seconds are alloted to answer to one question.
Likewise there are 5 questions, you can see each question one after the the other by answering and moving forward on clicking "Next". You won't be able to move forward to next question until you answer the question and click "next".
You will find the correct answer immediately after attempting the question. If the option that you have choosed is wrong, then it will indicate the correct option immediately. Otherwise it will remain the same option which is the right option.
When you don't answer to a question within the time, then it will show the correct answer and next button to move to the next question.
After answering to every question in the quiz, the scores will be seen immediately and you can also retake the quiz on clicking "Replay Quiz".
Here, I implemented the time limit to each question and created a "Retry quiz" button to retake the quiz again.
